        <i
          >“Concentrate every minute like a Roman-like a man—on doing what’s in
          front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly,
          willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other
          distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last
          thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop
          letting your emotions override what your mind tells you.”</i
